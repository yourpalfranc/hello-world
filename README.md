# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository following the Hello-World Tutorial.
I'm making a effort to learn more about version control.
This looks like a good place to start.
Hopefully, I'll be able to make this work with Aptana Studio 3 pretty easily??


So, I've added some text from down here in Aptana Studio.

And, now some more text since the first didn't seem to work??

OK, it appears we might be getting somewhere??
